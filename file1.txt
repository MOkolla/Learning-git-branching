Try to answer your own question using the data. You can subset the data in whichever way you desire as long as it is (sociologically) meaningful. For example, in the case of a cooffending network, you could group nodes by attributes such as sex, group edges such as repeat/non-repeating cooffenses, use the weighted or unweighted co-offending networks, focus on the largest connected component, etc. Think of how you may want to subset the data in the context of the CAVIAR or the social networks, or the publicly available network data set you have chosen.
