Clearly states a sociological question which is interesting and relevant to the data. The question must be sociologically motivated: for example, “Compare the network structure in 2003 vs 2009" is not a good question, without further context. If you have some reason to believe that the network structure changes in those years, then you should make that your central question: for example, “Did crimes involving youth offenders become more organized and structured over the years" is a better question, from which comparing the structure in different years becomes part of the methodology to answer the question. More examples of possible questions for cooffending networks are provided below.
